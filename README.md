#### Food preparedness
2,000 calories per person per day at a minimum

Target minimum of 30 days of food stored at home or second location.  Build up slowly over time - look for sales and stock up when items are discounted.  Buy in bulk.  Buy extra every time you go shopping.

Water will be in short supply so avoid food high in salt or that require a lot of water to reconstitute.

Freeze-dried products require little water to make edible; have higher nutritional value than dehydrated foods; have a large variety of foods available; are lightweight and easy to carry.
